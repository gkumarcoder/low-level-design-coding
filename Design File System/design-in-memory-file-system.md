Approach #1 Using separate Directory and File List 

The root directory acts as the base of the directory structure. Each directory contains two hashmaps namely *dirs* and *files* 

The dirs contains data in the form:

 [(subdirectory1_name: subdirectory1_structure),(subdirectory2_name : subdirectory2_structure)]

 The files contains data in the form

 [(file1: file1_contents),(file2:file2_contents)...]
