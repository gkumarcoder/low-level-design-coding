Approach #1 Using separate Directory and File List[Accepted]

We start our discussion by looking at the directory structure used. The root directory acts as the base of the directory structure. Each directory contains two hashmaps namely dirsdirsdirs and filesfilesfiles. The dirsdirsdirs contains data in the form [(subdirectory1_name:subdirectory1_structure),(subdirectory2_name:subdirectory2_structure)...][(subdirectory_1\_name: subdirectory_{1\_structure}), (subdirectory_2\_name: subdirectory_{2\_structure})...][(subdirectory 
1
​
 _name:subdirectory 
1_structure
​
 ),(subdirectory 
2
​
 _name:subdirectory 
2_structure
​
 )...].
